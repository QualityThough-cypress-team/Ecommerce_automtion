Good Morning !!!!!

We understand invoke  , trigger , its to handle object properties or functions
cy.fixture() is used to load the data into the tests 
cy.readFile() is used to load the data - dynamically it fetch the data from the file - latest from the file if any assertion or any command get failed. 

Read the data from CSV file . 
comma separated values 

To read this csv file we can take the help of neat-csv plugin or package 

1. npm install neat-csv@5

2. const neat-CSV= require('neat-csv') //importing the neat-csv capabilities into your test file with above  statement 
3. cy.fixture('testData.csv').then(neat-csv).then(testData)

4. Math.floor()
math.ramdom() 

finally we will achieve it 

1. how to read CSV file data into cypress with the help of neat-CSV 
2. Read the data through for loop 
3. read the data from random row number 
Data driven testing 
Custom keywords  => 

are useful to maintain repetive code at commands.js file with a name and it can be used across allyour test

login
logout 
shopping cart 
search 
cy.search() 
cy.shoppingcart()
