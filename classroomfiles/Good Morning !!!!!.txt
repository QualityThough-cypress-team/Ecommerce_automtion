Good Morning !!!!!

We understand => 

How to use JavaScript for your cypress automation.
1. Declaration of variables 
2. Operators 
3. Data types 
4. conditional statements 
5. Loops 
6. Classes import and export 
7. Strict mode to avoid the unnecessary errors 
8. Promises  - then , this keywords 
9. try and catch => error handling  - throw and finally 
We will able to customize your cypress automation with the help of JS . 

=> what is promise ?
is confirmation accept/Reject for future outcome 

if it is true =>  do this 
if it is false => do this 
but this true or false confirmation not yet present , it depends on the future outcome. 

we understand chocolate example : 

You ask for a chocolate , mom says that if available I will give it you. 

mom , needs to check is chocolate available or not , to do so some time is required - 
after this check only I can confirm whether I am giving the chocolate or not.

giving the chocolate is promise => if chocolate is available =>  I can give 
if it is not available => I cant => 
I replicated this example with in JS => by using promises.

new promise(resolve, reject)
resolve => true => then to resolve the condition 
reject => false  => catch to  get the error message for rejection. 

suppose if we are handling apis  => application program interfaces. 
without UI we can do the transaction. 
That we  access the URI to do some transaction => 
if service is available we complete this promise 
if service is terminated we can not complete this promise
