Good Morning !!!!!

Recap!!!!!

Few actions commands and then we do have a basic understanding on how we can run JS code in a browser console. 

1. open a browser 
2. open the developer options  => F12 /Inspect the element / Settings  / more tools  / developer options 
3. Console Tab with in the developer options 

4. In this console tab , you can execute the JS code by pressing enter in the console after you JS code 

console.log("your statement", x) 
x is known as variable . 
we can change this value 

We can define the variables in 3 possible ways 

var x=10; oldest process to define a variable => 2015 or before 

let y =20;  // just it is a better usage compared to var

const z=100; // it is used to define a  constant value . which can not be changed in the future. 

suppose pi =3.14  //  by any change this is not suppose to be changed . 

in this case we can define variable with const

1. What is blocked scope => 
with in the {} you are not suppose to do any things 
redeclare with in the block scope is not possible for const 
2. declaration  => let x , var y, Define the variable name but not assigned any value . 
3. initialization => x=10; Assigning the value to the variable 
4. var, let and const  => three possibilities we do have to define a variable in Java script
5. We need to understand var . this is only for your interview sake . why because this is oldest procedure to define the variable (<2015/ beforeES6) 
	


var can redeclare /reassign / hoisting  etc... 
let /const  => both of the based on the need

const =>  values that do not change in the future 
let  => value that may  change in the future 

const name=your value  // do not change in the future 
let age= 23 //do change in the future 
age 24
