Good Morning !!!!!

We are trying to understand how to automate a web application by using cypress automation tool.

Cypress is a modern web automation tool ! =>

Chromium  => chrome/edge /canara/electron 
Firefox => firefox 
Webkit  => safari 

If you are testing the application on multiple browser then that testing is known as browser compatibility testing 
cross browser testing 
main aim is to check all your UI +functionality working fine in the different browsers. 

=> We need to understand specialities of the cypress 
1. Visual debugging  => 
2. Timetravel 
3. Auto wait  => for your component before perform assertion 
assertion is nothing but adding verification step 
Expected result  => Assertion 
4. Retries  => cypress will retrie when it failed first time 
=> flakieness  => not stable 
5. Easy integration with CI tools  => continuous integration 
=> 
6. Easy integration with JIRA => 
automated my cypress  => create defect in JIRa when your test fail. 
7. Easy integration with Communciation channels like Teams 
=======================================================
Cypress is a modern web automation tool and it is fully baked . 

cypress will be ready with in couple of mins  => 

1. Pre requisites 
a. nodejs =>  downloaded in your computer / Install the nodejs 
Nodejs is used to run your javascript code  => 
cypress developed in java script 

java script run time => it will execute or run javascript programs 

> node -v
v22.15.0
> 

>npm -v 
=> fetch all the modules required to run cypress 


npm => node package manager  => 

install 
upgrade 


b. VScode  => IDE (integrated development environment ) 
Download and install 
c. Create a project folder  => ecommerce 
d. supply this ecommerce folder to the VScode 
e. Open the terminal in the ecommerce 

to install cypress  => 
npm install cypress --save-dev => developer  version 
npm install cypress  => released version 
npm install cypress --save-dev

a. a folder with the name node_modules  => 
175 packages copied into your project folder 
b.  package.json  => a project level file 
a place holder to keep all your project information 
1. Installed packages 
2. your project name 
3. GitHub url 
=> npm init 
=====================================================
How to run cypress in UI mode  => user interface 
how to run cypress in CLI mode command line interface

npx  => node package executor  => this will execute the required packages to run your application 
cypress.config.js  => javascript 
this file contains all the configurations for the cypress 
project  >> Cypress  >> support  => 
a. e2e.js => pre requisites to run before your actual test
b. commands.js  => custom commands 
cypress  >> fixtures =>
example.json  => test data 

do have key value pairs:
{ 
"name" : "Ram",
"Qualification":"Btech",
"Year of Passout":"2000"
}
npx cypress run  => CLI 
npx cypress open  => GUI  


- electron
 - chrome
 - chromium
 - chrome-for-testing
 - edge
 - firefox

Tasks to be done:

1. Install the cypress in your computer 
2. Run at least one test case in the UI mode 
3. Run  the tests in CLI mode in headless 
4. Run the tests in CLI mode in headed mode 
5. Run the tests with different  browsers
