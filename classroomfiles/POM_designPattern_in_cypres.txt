Good morning !!!!!

Recap!!!!!

We understand how to handle different UI components 
Iframes 
alerts 
======================================================
Now we need understand the frame work :

Design pattern POM => and then move on to BDD 

Framework is nothing but a folder structure or organize the different activities at different folders. 

cypress : 

Project folder => 
Cypress  => 
   e2e =. to write tests 
   support => e2e.js and commands.js these files will execute before your test . 
   fixtures  => this is the place to provide test data 
                .json file 
                 .csv file 
    screenshots => whenever your test fail cypress will capture the screenshot that  will be exists int he screenshot folder 
    videos => 

   e2e => 

how you are organizing the tests 

with in e2e => how do you manage or oraganize your tests to give more readability to the customer 
1. POM => page object model 

this model we need to segregate the automation code between two file 

currently everything in our one test. 
test.cy.js  => 

Pages is a factory to produce all the selectors and all methods belongs to that page 
so one place we do change if any selector or methods we have to change in future . 

so it is easy to write and maintain code -
and reusability of the selectors and methods for our automation 
we do not want to write the same kind of test again and again 
instead we create the methods  in the class and use them whenever we want to use
