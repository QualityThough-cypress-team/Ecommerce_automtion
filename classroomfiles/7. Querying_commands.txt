Good Morning !!!!!

Recap !!!!!

We understand how to write you own selectors by using CSS  selectors 
1. Basic CSS selectors 
2. combinator CSS selector 
3. Attribute CSS selector 
=> [class|="top"] 
class="top test"
class="top-test"

=> [class^="top"] whose value starts with top 
=> [class$="test"] whose value ends with test

Now Cypress do have navigational commands to do the above selection with in the cypress -  there is no much dependency on css combinator selector or attribute selectors 

=> Cypress Querying commands  => cy.get()  
=> cypress navigational/traversal commands 
=> window commands 
=> Querying commands 
1. get is used to locate the element by using css selectors 



 Best Practice: Use data-* attributes to provide context to your selectors and isolate them from CSS or JS changes.
