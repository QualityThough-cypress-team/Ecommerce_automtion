1. We understand how to connect with GitHub

in this GitHub => 
how to create a repo from GitHub desktop 
how to commit the repo changes in the local server
and then push the changes to origin 

If you have a branch v1 and you have some changes in the branch v1 which are not exist in the master branch in this case we need to 
1. create a pull request to merge the code from v1 branch to main branch 
2. once pull request is created - repo admin will review your changes and then merge the code from v1 to main branch 

// Cypress fixtures and hooks . 

fixtures are used to load the external data into your test 
cy.fixture('filename.json')// this filename should be avialble 
cypress >> fixtures >>filename.json

but in my test case as a pre requisite i want to load this testdata before my test execution. 

in your manual test case there is pre requisite. that means before your start your testcase you have to execute these pre requisites. 

to automate this with in the cypress we need to use cypress hooks 

2 types of hooks in cypress => 
1. execute before your test 
before() // this will execute only once before  all tests 
that means very first step  beforeHooks will execute 

beforeEach() //cypress code 
this hook will execute after before()hook and before every it block 


2. execute only after your test 
after() this is the last step in your test => after all tests (it blocks ) and afterEach()  we will execute only once) => this is used to cleanup activities.
afterEach()
this will execute after every it block . 


before()
beforeEach()
it()
afterEach()
beforeEach()
it()
afterEach()
after()

cy.fixture() is used to read the data from the file 
this should exist in cypress/fixtures/file name 
once it is loaded we need provide a nick name for this data exist with in the file 
that nick name we can provide you as aliasing name 
as
cy.fixture().as('data')

data.username
data.password 
data.name
data.email
data.password
data.age
data.address
data.xyz 
cy.fixtures().then((data)=>{

this.data=data // this step provide the access to the data outside of this fixture folder 


})
