Good Morning !!!!!
Recap : 

1. we understand Basics of cypress
=> how to setup cypress in your local computer
=> How to use playground to traceout the UI components 
=> how to use studio commands to record the  scripts 
    => record the test step  => Record the new command with in the  existing testcase
    => record the entire new test => record the new test case

=> How to locate the  element  => selectors 
   => CSS selectors  => 
   1. Playground
   2. Developer options  => inspect 
   3. selectorshub/chropath 
       div[class='container'] h1

         a. Tagname selector= tagame
         b. class name selector= .classname 
             .classname.classname2.classname.3 
         c. ID selector  = #id
         d. Attribute selector = [attribute="value"]
               combinator selector

b. Perform an action 

  Based on the UI element we can able to perform actions 
1. Querying commands => is used to located the element 
   cy.get("selector").action() 
   cy.contains("text").action()
   
   click()
rtclick()
dblclick()
type()
type(,{delay:2000})
select()
check()
uncheck()n

traversal commands to identify the element 
navigational commands to use the browser options like 
go(forward)
go(backword)
reload()  
reload(true)



3. Assertions : Verification of perticual outcome 

should("have.text","text")
should("have.value","value")
should("be.visible")
should("be.enable")
should("be.not .enable") 
have.class 
have.attribute 
like this many assertions 

if you want to automate any manual test case 

1. Locate and navigate to that UI component
    querying commands 
    traversal commands
    Navigational commands  
2. If there is any action you can perform on it
    Action commands  
3. Add an assertion to check the outcome 
   Assertions 

=> basically we can automate any page by using above 3 steps . 

but it is not sufficient to automate any website. 
website contains many pages => end to end testing we need to learn few more things 

1. Understand the application knowledge /Domain knowledge 
ecommerce domain => one project - 
I will explain domain  => 
you can write manual test cases for those ecommerce functionalities 
=> 15min of time in our lecture contributed for this domain knowledge.

we need to automate the ecommerce application 
2. Different tools used in the project 
=> JIRA /QC /ASana ...etc
I will create a JIRA and share the access to you. 
We can create all your requirements in the  Backlog - JIRA User stories 
respective userstories we can convert into test cases 
execute these test cases and see the result in the manual test case 

we can automate these test cases by using cypress 

=> test management tool  => Zephyrscale / AIO ..etc 


3. Automating the manual tests with in the framework 

cypress is a automation tool 

Framework is required 

=>JavaScript  => done 

1. Cypress folder structure => done 
    cypress 
        Fixtures => examples.json 
        support 
               => commands.js 
               => e2e.js 
     cypress.config.js 
     package.json 

2. fixtures as part of frame work  => fixtures folder 
cy.fixture() // this is used to read the test data from the external files 
cy.readFile()
cy.writeFile() 

3. Custom commands in the cypress 
    whenever we do have repeated statements in your test files that steps we can make a command in your cypress 
that command is known as custom command 

cy.login("","") {
}
4. POM => design pattern 
we classified our project into pages 
each page we do have class file in this class file we can store all locators script 
pageName.js 

and we create test file 
pageTest.cy.js  => 
here we can create test file 
either in the regular format 
BDD 

5. Cypress cloud  => another product provided by cypress 
=> commercial involved  => 
paid version 
=> detailed reports for the runs 
=> GitHub integration 
=> teams integrations 
=> if you commit a change that will trigger automatically and provide the result 
=> CI integration => gitactions 
=> parallel execution 

6. BDD frame work  => behavioral driven development 
BDD Test = into automation 
Given 
When 
Then 
Manual test case into BDD test case  => cucumber 

then convert this BDD tests into cypress automation 


pre requisites : 
ecommerce application 
JIRA 
AIO
GitHub 
Gitactions 

=> we can do slowly one after another along with your cypress frame work 
1. ecommerce application 
2. GitHub 
3. Folderstrcuture  / Fixtures ()
