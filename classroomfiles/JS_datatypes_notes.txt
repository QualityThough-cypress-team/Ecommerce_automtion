Good Morning !!!!!

Data types : 

how many kinds of data a variable can store. 

Data types we can classified into two types 

1.primitive data types 
2. non primitive or reference data types 

1. Primitive data type : 
This data type is storing the single data 
x=10 => Number
name='ram' => string 
value=true  => boolean
undefined  => undefined 
null  => forcibly you are assigning the null value 

We do have above primitive data types in JS => before 2015 =>  ES6
