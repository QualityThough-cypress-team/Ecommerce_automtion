Good Morning !!!!!

We would like to understand the importance of Git/GitHub
along with practical  explanation. 

After this session we collaboratively work on same project or repository daily. 

so you can directly work on classfiles and tasks with in the same repository . 

in future we can integrate this repository to the cypress cloud /CI pipeline .

1. Create an account in GitHub (underlying technology) 
2. GitHub desktop - 
3. login from githubdesktop to GitHub 

GitHub desktop is GUI tool to connect with your GitHub repositories from your local machines. 

git contains commands 
GitHub desktop  is not having the CLI => GUI


1. Visibility of the repository - repo -> 
if it is public you can access  => open source projects are public repos 
if it  is not public you can not access the project code - instead you can see 404 error message. 

2. how to create a local repository -> 
a. Open the GitHub desktop in your computer 
b. Navigate to File Menu >> Add local repository 
c. Provide the repository/folder location in the path textbox or go to the repo through navigation
d. supply the location of the code where we do have and create the repository 
e. After creating the repository => we can publish this repository to the GitHub .  

f. Add a file into the local repository 
g. See the changes in the GitHub desktop with the help of diff tool 
h. Commit the changes to the local git server with a informative comment 
=> local changed updated to the local server 
I. push to the origin  => GitHub repo is the origin
