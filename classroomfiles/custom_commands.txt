We need to work on 
1. Custom commands 
2. cypress cloud 

What is custom commands in cypress?
reusable code we can create as a custom command .

1. Login 
2. signup 
3. search
4. clickon button 

cypress >> support 

             commands.js 

you can create a new custom command 
or overwrite existing cypress command 

There are two API available for adding custom commands:

Cypress.Commands.add() - use to add a custom command to use when writing tests
Cypress.Commands.overwrite() - use to override an existing built-in Cypress
cy.visit() it is already exist - to launch the browser with definedURL 

but now if you change this with new overwrite() api that is new command behavior 

now cy.visit() // is working with the new code in your project

Cypress.Commands.add('clickLink', (label) => {
  cy.get('a').contains(label).click()
})
Cy.prress.Commmands.add('enterData',(type,input) =>{

cy.get('input').contains('type').type(input)
})
