We are understanding how to read data from fixtures 

to read the data we are using hooks 
before hook => only execute once before your first test
beforeEach hook => executes before your every test 
after Each hook =>execute after your every test 
after hook => executes after  last test .  this is last step in test 

Beforehook only execute with the first it block 
if first it block is skipped then before hook also skipped 
afterhook only execute with the last it block 
if last it block is skipped then afterhook also skipped
beforehook is used to provide the one time prerequisite which will execute before first test only 
after hook is used to provide the onetime cleanup which will execute after last test only 
beforeEach hook is used to provide the prerequisite for every test . this prerequisite will execute first then your test execute
afterEach hook is used to provide the cleanup activity for every test. This will cleanup executes after every test . 
after this hook code execution only your it block body will execute 

before
before Each for first test 
first testbody 
after Each  for first test 
before Each for second test 
second test body 
after each for second test 
before each for third test 
3rd test body 
after each for third test 
after 
=======================================================
Fixture we need to read the data from external files 
.json file 
{
"name": "ram",
"age":30,
"Qualification": "Btech",
"year of passout":2000
}
example.json  => having the data , by using this data we need to do the testing 
Data driven testing  => read data from external files
where is this file cypress > fixtures >> example.json 

to retrieve the data we need to use same as object properties 
object.property 
example.name 
testdata.age
cy.fixture() is used to load the data into test
